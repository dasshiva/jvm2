This directory has the VM support library.

The VM support library is responsible for providing the core functionality required for the 
VM to execute classes. This includes classes such as Object, String etc.
All files here are prefixed by "VM" to indicate they are a part of this library.

The VM will dynamically load classes from the library as needed and call methods as specified
in the user application. This library acts as a replacement for the JDK provided standard library.
All calls to standard library methods will be remapped by the VM to use the methods provided here.
For example a call to java.lang.Object.hashCode() is remapped to VMObject.hashCode()
and so on and so forth.
